What it does:
A simple minecraft mod that adds the ability to grow grapes, ferment them in a cask to make wine, and then to either drink that wine or use it to create stronger potions

Items to introduce:
- "Grape seed"
	- Can be found in mineshafts with melon and pumpkin seeds
	- Can be planted on a dirt block or grass block that has a wooden fence on it to create a trellis

- "Grape"
	- Food, similar to Melon Slices in nutritional content
	- Can be crafted to produce 4 grape seeds
	- 8 grapes and 1 bucket can be crafted to create 1 grape bucket
	
- "Grape Bucket"
	- Food Container, similar to Milk Bucket in nutritional content (slightly better)
	- Can be used in a cask to produce Wine Bottle- like 3 or 4 emeralds
	
- "Wine Bottle"
	- Potion, similar to "Potion of Slow", might have to play with the effect a bit
	- High sale price with Priest Villagers
	- Potentially, in the future, we can use this as a base for other potions (stretch goal)
	
- "Barrel"
	- Recipe: 	Oak Planks, Oak Planks Slab, Oak Planks
				Iron Bar, Nothing, Iron Bar
				Oak Planks, Oak Planks Slab, Oak Planks
	- Operates like a furnace
	- Grape bucket must go on top, converts to empty bottle
	- Glass bottle must go on bottom, converts to wine bottle
	- Takes a long time to forge
